# Why Computers Are Bad at Math (And Humans Aren’t)

A tiny interactive demo that shows why `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3` in programming, and what that tells us about how computers handle numbers.

## What this is

This project demonstrates a common surprise in programming: computers sometimes produce results that look mathematically wrong. The goal is to show _why this happens_ in the simplest way possible, without heavy theory or jargon.

## How it works

- Enter two numbers
- Click **Add**
- The result is shown exactly as the computer calculates it

Try:

```txt
0.1 + 0.2
```

## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

No frameworks. No libraries.

## Why this exists

This demo was created as part of a learning project for a tech portfolio blog focused on explaining software engineering concepts in plain English.
